EXCEL FORMULAS FOR ITAD SHEETS

These formulas are intended to automate and simplify the R2 documentation process while upholding meticulous documentation standards. 

The formulas preloves around the assigned number, given to the item when it is being received by the ITAD Dept. (e.i. "E1281")

The technician should quickly record the serial and product number, then add the assigned number to the item from the correlating row the item falls in to, assigned a matching removable sticker to the item and store it for later testing. 

When it comes time for the item to be tested, there is no need to enter meticulous documentation again. The technician simply states if the item is to be "Scrapped" or Tested/Verified" in the "Incoming Device Log". Enter the assigned number into the appropriate test log for that specific item and the data will be automatically entered. Some manual entry will be required for items that need specific entry such as volts for AC adapters, impendence values for speakers, bulb hours for projectors and so on.
